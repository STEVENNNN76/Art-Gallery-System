# Art-Gallery-System

*Introduction*

This project aims to contain a variety of aspects associated with an art gallery, such as details about the gallery, the artists, their paintings, clients (the people who purchased the paintings), etc. The primary objective is to inform art enthusiasts about details , including the artwork and the artists.

Abstract

This project's primary goal is to assist the art gallery industry in marketing its artwork online through its own website. Each painting or sculpture will have information stored in the system, including the author and Price

Depending on the views they wished to publish to their website, the management can upload several versions of each piece of art that is housed.
 
The art gallery business can post the artworks that are for sale and the buyer can request an order for the artwork. 

The management will get in touch with the customer to confirm the transaction and to arrange for the delivery of the artwork.
